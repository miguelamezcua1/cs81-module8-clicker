# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?

Actually seeing how 'getElementById' connects the HTML to the JavaScript helped a lot. It made it easier to understand how to update things like the counter and message areas live on the screen.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?

I wanted each message to feel like part of a "snack-collecting" journey, so it builds from silly to ridiculous. The 100-click message ends the game as a kind of mini "win" moment.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?

I had a typo where I wrote 'textcontext' instead of 'textContent' and that caused nothing to show up. It reminded me to check spelling carefully in JS.

## What personal twist did you add?

I changed the theme to “Snack Attack” instead of a plain cookie counter. I also had the background color change at certain milestones to make it feel more alive and fun without using emojis.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?

Any game that rewards repeated interaction or tracking uses event-based logic like this. It is a common pattern in interactive web apps.
